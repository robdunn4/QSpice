Release Notes

0.9.3
* Initial public release.

0.9.4
* Improved parsing of double/float attribute values.  Now handles suffixes and
  engineering notation.
* Summary/Code tab contents now display Latin1 charset properly (extended
  ASCII).
* Fixed error dropping final line of templates when not ended with newline.

0.9.5.1
* Removed uData array size embedded template substitution parameter.  Will add
  back to code block substitution parameter to ensure that it is correct when
  uData array changes.
* Added initial support for "bus ports."  QCodeGen *should* detect malformed 
  bus port names and generate proper code when properly formed.  Needs more
  testing to compare to QSpice code generator.
* Full support for bus ports and "bit registers" (similar to Bit Vectors) not
  yet implemented.
