# QCodeGen &mdash; Proof of Concept Code

QCodeGen (a temporary name) is an attempt to reproduce the QSpice template code generator for more convenient use and to add more features, reliability, and flexibility.

This is experimental code.  By "experimental," I mean <b><i>really, really experimental!</b></i>  It's not feature-complete or thoroughly tested yet.

If you want to play along, I am providing binaries for 64-bit Windows and full QT project source code if you'd prefer to compile it yourself.

I will definitely need folk to test the code-generation and compare it to the QSpice-generated code.  Do let me know if you try it.  In fact, please try to break it.  Let me know what works/doesn't work.

## Files (Very Early and Incomplete POC Stuff)

* QCodeGen_Dev_Doc.pdf &mdash; Developer notes.
* QCodeGen_User_Doc.pdf &mdash; Totally incomplete User documentation (installation, settings, code templates, etc. )
* Binaries &mdash; Folder containing project binaries.
* Sources &mdash; Folder containing Qt project sources.
