# SerialIO Components

QSpice components to implement serial input & output buffers.

This is an initial step towards generic SPI master/slave components for QSpice.

*At this point, this is <b>Proof of Concept</b> stuff.  The code is not well-thought-through, well-tested, well-organized, nor well-commented.  The code is the only documentation.*

***You have been warned.***

## SerialOut -- A basic serial output component
* SerialOut.cpp &mdash; Basic serial output component.
* SerialBuf.h &mdash; Common header for serial input/output components.
* SerialOut.qsch &mdash; Component test fixture.
* SerialOut.dll &mdash; Compiled DLL.

The code compiles with MS VC.
