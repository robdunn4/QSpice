# PID Controller Component
QSpice component implementing a discrete PID controller in C++.

QSpice forum member @KSKelvin deserves full credit for this component, the excellent documentation, and demonstration files.  Many thanks for sharing!

Updated 2024.09.26:  Kelvin updated the code to incorporate recent changes to the QSpice component interface.  Thanks, Kelvin!

Note:  You can find Kelvin's excellent QSpice documentation, symbols, and other stuff on his [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/KSKelvin-Github/Qspice/).
