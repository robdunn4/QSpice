# QTcpServer Project

This project provides a simple TCP-based client/server framework for QSpice C-Block components.

See [QTcpServer_Overview.pdf](QTcpServer_Overview.pdf) for details.

<i>Note:  The project code isn't particularly complicated but isn't intended for beginners.  It uses the Qt development toolkit for the server code and Microsoft Visual Studio for the client-side QSpice DLL component code.  Worse, the documentation is rather incomplete so you'll need to "read the code" for details.</i>
