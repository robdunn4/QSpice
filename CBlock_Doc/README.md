# CBlock_Doc

Various documentation relevant to C-Block component development.


## C-Block Basics

This is an attempt to de-mystify C-Block component development.  The first couple of sections should (I hope) get less experienced C/C++ coders past the first hurdles.  Remaining sections share my (very likely wrong and definitely incomplete) understanding of the MaxExtStepTime() and Trunc() functions.

* CBlock_Basics.pdf &mdash; The basics document.
* CBlock_Basics.qsch &mdash; An incomplete tutorial schematic with C-Block component (EvilAmp).
* evilamp.cpp &mdash; Sample DLL source for CBlock_Basics stuff.
